## description :

This is a website for fans of Moroccan food. It features various recipes; users are able to create an account (temporary) and save recipes as their favourites (and delete them from their favourites too). They're also able to comment and read other users' comments underneath each recipe (tips, etc). The website comprises the following pages: home, recipes, log-in, saved for later and a contact form.

## How to use

Using Casablaca Cooking: any visitor can view recipes on the website however in order to add comments or save recipes for later, users should create an account.  There is a default account/user embedded in the programme which is user@gmail.com and password 123456.  Once logged in, users can save recipes for later by clicking the heart symbol (it will change colour on being clicked), and view the recipes they have saved on the 'saved for later' page.  To unsave a recipe, they should delete it from the 'saved for later' page.  They can send a message via the contact form, and users can add comments under each recipe using the corresponding form.
